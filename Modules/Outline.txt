Modules
1. Image Processing
2. 2D to 3D
3. Pathfinding using A*
    Result is a 2D image of the floor plan with the pathfinding overlayed on top.
    Civillians should be able to click to place a marker for their current position in the building.
    Emergency operators place markers for the Rescue Team in the same manner.
    Pathfinding is done from Rescue Team (R) to Civillian (C).

    For entry/exit AKA "Extraction," the path is calculated from (R) to outside the building. 
        This can be done by calculating which border (top, right, bottom, or left) of the floor plan is closest to (R).

4. Overlaying floor plan with the 3D Model
    This is what we render and show to users.
