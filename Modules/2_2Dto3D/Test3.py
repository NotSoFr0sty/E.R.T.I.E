'''Module 2 - 2D to 3D Conversion
Algorithm:
Read processed floor plan and get its dimensions
Set faceCount = total_no_of_pixels_of_floor_plan * 2
Initialize a numpy zeros array, called data, with shape = faceCount
Read the floor plan pixel by pixel
Create 2 faces for each pixel (each face is made up of exactly 3 vertices)
If the pixel is white, then set the facesâ€™ Z values to wallHeight
Else set Z values to the default, 0
Create the 3D mesh using mesh.Mesh(data)
Save the mesh as an STL model
